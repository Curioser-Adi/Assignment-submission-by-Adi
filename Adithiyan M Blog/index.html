<p class="para3"> This is the sound that comes from the movement of two hands of a clock which we might not notice at many times. But, if you’re writing an exam in school/college when the supervisor says “10 minutes to finish your answer paper” suddenly we hear the ticking sound in the wall clocks in the exam hall and in the wrist watch which increases our anxiety to the peak. Christopher Nolan uses this Tik Tock sounds in most of his movies where time plays a major role. It’s not an understatement that Christopher Nolan is a “Timephile”. It’s surprising to notice that even he has used Music as an narrating device to show the element of time thanks to his collaborations with Music Composers Hans Zimmer, David Julyan and Ludwig Gorannson.  </p>

    <p class="para4"> In “The Dark Knight” Trilogy, “The Prestige” and “Inception” the usage of tik tock sounds in some pieces of background score gave us a seat-edge experience. This is used effectively in Interstellar movie during the scene of Miller planet where for every 1.25 seconds there is a tick tock which is used to denote that a day is passing on Earth. In another scene where Cooper docks the Spaceship to Endurance Space Station with less fuel the beats per minute increases which induces the anxiety to the audience.  </p>

        <p class="para5"> In his next outing “Dunkirk” he took this to the next level where the tick tock sound of his personal watch is incorporated into the background score throughout the movie by Hans Zimmer and Sound Design team. From the start till the end the ticking clock increases the tension in the screenplay. The score gives the feeling of infinite rising/falling but its not. Its an auditory illusion termed as “Shephard’s tone”.  </p>

        <p class="para6"> In Shepard’s tone, the tones are separated by an octave and are arranged in ascending order. For eg. take three tones which consist of high pitch, mid pitch and low pitch. As the tones move up the scale, the highest pitched tone gets quieter, the mid-pitched tone gets louder and the lowest pitched tone gets audible. When these three are put in a loop, it produces an illusion which gives a feel of infinite rising and falling. The love for Tick Tock Sounds for Nolan is also seen in his recent film “Tenet”. This Sheer Brilliance is what makes him stand out in the field of cinema. </p>
